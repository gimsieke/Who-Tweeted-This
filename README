This Chrome extension will memorize the tweet from which you followed
a link. Useful if you 
a) opened 20 tabs by clicking on links in tweets and, 
b) after reading the linked page, feel an urge to reply or retweet,
but
c) can’t find the corresponding tweet in your timeline any more.


To do:

- Proper short URL resolution. To my surprise, this is all but
  trivial since XMLHttpRequest transparently resolves all the
  redirections, and there’s no raw socket HTTP thing. Will try
  Websockets for this eventually. Until then, we’ll have to put
  up with what Twitter’s offering in the data-expanded-url
  attribute. This is the URL, stripped by any GET parameters
  and fragment identifiers. It will not work well with sites
  that distinguish their pages by something like ?id=…, potentially
  giving credit to a tweet that linked to another page of the 
  same site.
