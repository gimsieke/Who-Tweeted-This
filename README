This Chrome extension will memorize the tweet from which you followed
a link. Useful if you 
a) opened 20 tabs by clicking on links in tweets and, 
b) after reading the linked page, feel an urge to reply or retweet,
but
c) canâ€™t find the corresponding tweet in your timeline any more.


To do:

- proper short URL resolution
- multiple tweets (associate a list of tweet paths with a URL)
- nicer presentation of tweets in the popup window
